Notes for Friday:
1. Test to see if we can call and use the account tables built by default authentication feature (DAF)
2. Test to see if we can switch sql database connection, and rename it appropriately (renaming everything including tables)

3. If those 2 above fail, we have to create our own tables again for accounts.  
3b. Then look up how to hash and securely store the password.
